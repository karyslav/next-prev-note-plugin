This is Omsidian MD plugin that add functionality for previous/next note jumping via ctrl-shift left/right keys or via buttons in Obsidian GUI ribbon.
Unfortunately, when you select different than A to Z sorting, you must also select in jumping menu corresponding value. After that, sorting works same as for A to Z for every other option.

This plugin is provided as it is, without any warranty.
Use at your own risk!

I have no idea what I am doing but I am doing it with love.

Installation:
Copy the whole folder of repository (next-prev-note-plugin) the plugin into your Obsidian MD folder, where your community plugins are.
